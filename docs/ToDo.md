# ToDo


- [x] CLI Handler
- [x] Base Request handler and class based handler
- [x] Queue System so Movies, Series and ALL can be handled by the
same logic.
- [x] Handle each "file" in the queue system as a entity with data
which has things like where to download, type,... so that they can be
spit into the correct handler.
- [x] Add a "Use input" system which is optional if you use cli
parameters. (Automation)
-  [ ] Add a way for single episode downloads, from ep to ep,
from ep to END, all, season X to season Y, season X to END, start 
to season.
- [ ] Add a way to download multiple Anime's/series/movie's at once.
- [ ] Translation - Logging_handler ~ REWORK THIS GARBAGE
- [ ] FileMoon ~ Needs fixing.
- [ ] Fix CLI Debug parameter

# IDEAS

- [ ] Gui?
- [ ] Web interface?
- [ ] Modules like plugins/Extensions?
- [ ] Handle Providers as modules? Would allow them to be updated
and added a lot easier.
- [ ] Have an internal list based on speed from which the provider
gets selected.
